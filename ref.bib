  abstract = {Fault analysis in solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays is a fundamental
	task to increase reliability, efficiency and safety in PV systems.
	Conventional fault protection methods usually add fuses or circuit
	breakers in series with PV components. But these protection devices
	are only able to clear faults and isolate faulty circuits if they
	carry a large fault current. However, this research shows that faults
	in PV arrays may not be cleared by fuses under some fault scenarios,
	due to the current-limiting nature and non-linear output characteristics
	of PV arrays.
	
	First, this thesis introduces new simulation and analytic models that
	are suitable for fault analysis in PV arrays. Based on the simulation
	environment, this thesis studies a variety of typical faults in PV
	arrays, such as ground faults, line-line faults, and mismatch faults.
	The effect of a maximum power point tracker on fault current is discussed
	and shown to, at times, prevent the fault current protection devices
	to trip. A small-scale experimental PV benchmark system has been
	developed in Northeastern University to further validate the simulation
	conclusions.
	
	Additionally, this thesis examines two types of unique faults found
	in a PV array that have not been studied in the literature. One is
	a fault that occurs under low irradiance condition. The other is
	a fault evolution in a PV array during night-to-day transition. Our
	simulation and experimental results show that overcurrent protection
	devices are unable to clear the fault under "low irradiance" and
	"night-to-day transition". However, the overcurrent protection devices
	may work properly when the same PV fault occurs in daylight. As a
	result, a fault under "low irradiance" and "night-to-day transition"
	might be hidden in the PV array and become a potential hazard for
	system efficiency and reliability.}

	task for increasing reliability and safety in PV systems. Fault classification
	allows identification of the possible fault type so that to expedite
	PV system recovery. However, because of the non-linear output characteristics
	of PV arrays, a variety of faults may be difficult to detect using
	conventional protection devices. Supervised learning methods have
	been previously proposed to detect and classify solar PV arrays.
	These methods rely on numerous labeled data for training models and,
	therefore, have drawbacks: 1) The labeled data on solar PV arrays
	is difficult or expensive to obtain; 2) The model requires updates
	as environmental conditions change. To solve these issues, this paper
	proposes a fault detection and classification method using graph-based
	semi-supervised learning (SSL). The proposed method only uses a few
	labeled data points, but relies instead on a large amount of inexpensive
	unlabeled data points. The method demonstrates self-learning ability
	in real-time operation. Simulation and experimental results verify
	the proposed method.}
