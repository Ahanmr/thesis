Make a list of possible failure conditions and find resources, i.e. proper papers, which describe them and possibly also how they affect power output.
It is also worth to mention failures that are out of scope (and mention this explictly) in order to show an understanding of the field.
This might for example be broken IV-curves which would require detection by performing sweeps actively.
List failures by category, building a ground for future textual descriptions, having many references.

Behaviour might differ between string installations and separate power chains for each panel.
These different constructs should be discussed in order to give the reader an overview of the problem being solved.

======================================
Categories of "fault conditions" exist:

* Existant during setup
  - mismatch effects due to different types of modules
    detected in "analysis model of mismatch power losses in PV systems" by comparing with the theoretical output
    , and constructing an approximate model of the panels
  

* Failure conditions occuring in existing systems

* constant energy loss
  - degradation, soiling, module defect, string defect ("automatic supervision and fault detection of PV systems..")

* short-time energy loss
  - shading, power limitation, error MPP tracking ("automatic supervision and fault detection of PV systems..")

"Graph based semi-supervised learning for fault detection and classification in solar photovoltaic arrays"
performs detection of two different "types" of faults, i.e. builds an analysis upon this distinction:

* line-line fault: accidental short-circuit between points carrying different potential
* open-circuit fault: accidental disconnection of current-carrying conductor

there are some papers discussing these categories more in-depth

("Decision tree-based fault detection and classification in solar photovoltaic arrays")
mentions "increased series resistance faults in PV strings", with a reference to "Fault detection by signal response in PV module strings"

"the master's thesis" gives the same categorisation into line-line, ground faults, and mismatch failures.
* part of the study is MPPT, which come into effect during transient failures.
  the MPPT will gradually improve the system performance after a short dip - might need to be accounted for.
* the different categories also inhibit different reactions - might be important
* due to MPPT the faulty panels might be limited to small currents and hence not trigger any current protections

===============================

Reasonable approaches
---------------------

Given characteristics in general case.

Build categories of errors and discuss what they are, why they are/(are not) hard to detect otherwise, and characteristics.

Build list of possible defects that can occur in solar panels (i.e. more fine-grained).
Figure out if they can be differentiated on this scale. Has specifics such as dust been differentiated?

Should simulation be mentioned in the background section?
Not really. The general power curve outline during the year is however of interest.
Relevant to make explicitly mention seasonal, geographical, and thermal variations
and tie these observations into the underlying model of the solar panel.
