Make list of all surveyed papers and make notes on notable results, and possibly useful things.

Also need to make a list of possible failures and how likely they affect solar panel output.
This will not be conclusive but mostly serve as a motivation to why it's important to detect faults.
Spend an appropiate amount of time on each failure and search for possible characterisations.

Generically, what kind of failure detection has been studied? in combination with partial shading?

Also need to spend some time on researching PV simulation.
Are there complete solutions available?
What data is available?
What's needed?

Then need to consider partial shading.
What research exist currently on these conditions?
How can regular patterns be detected in the pattern output?
Basically how a solution can be built.

The next step is to consider sudden power loss.
Does this failure condition exist in current research?

The next step is to consider gradual power loss.
Does this failure condition exist in current research?
